#### Branching
```Branching is a core concept in Git, and the entire GitHub flow is based upon it.<br>```

#### Add Commits
```each commit is considered a separate unit of change. This lets you roll back changes if a bug is found, or if you decide to head in a different direction.```

#### Pull Requests
```
when you have little or no code but want to share some screenshots or general ideas, when you're stuck and need help or advice, or when you're ready for someone to review your work. By using GitHub's @mention system in your Pull Request message, you can ask for feedback from <br>
If you're using a Fork & Pull Model, Pull Requests provide a way to notify project maintainers about the changes you'd like them to consider. <br>
If you're using a Shared Repository Model, Pull Requests help start code review and conversation about proposed changes before they're merged into the main branch.<br>
Pull Request comments are written in Markdown, so you can embed images and emoji, use ==pre-formatted text blocks, and other lightweight formatting==.
